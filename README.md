# Clustering Geolocation Data Intelligently in Python

### Problem Statement 

We have taxi rank locations, and want to define by clusters of these taxis where we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region

### Prerequisites

- Basic Matplotlib skills for plotting 2-D data clearly
- Basic understanding of Pandas and how to use it for data manipulation
- The concepts behind clustering algorithms

### Project Outline

Task 1 : Exploratory Data Anaylsis    
Task 2 : Visualizing Geographical Data    
Task 3 : Clustering Strength/Performance Metric    
Task 4 : K-Means CLustering    
Task 5 : DBSCAN    
Task 6 : HDBSCAN    
Task 7 : Address Outliers
